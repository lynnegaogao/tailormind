    "summary": "The document provides an introduction to causal inference, distinguishing prediction from causation and explaining the fundamental difference between passive observation and active intervention. It covers preliminary topics essential for causal inference, including types of causal questions, two types of data, two languages for causation, an illustrative example, and a difference between prediction and causation. After this, the document delves into counterfactuals detailing the use of potential outcomes, the concept of counterfactuals, and the importance of estimating the mean treatment effect.",
