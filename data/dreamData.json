Jimmy's father sent him back to Indiana after that to live with his aunt. W: So how did he get into acting? M: Well, first he acted in plays at high school, then he went to college in California where he got seriously into acting. In 1951 he moved to New York to do more stage acting. W: Then when did his movie career really start? M: 1955. His first starring role was in East of Eden. It was fabulous. Dean became a huge success.

M: Just one more, then he died in that car crash in California in 1955. W: What a tragedy! He only made three movies! So what made him the legend he still is today?

M: It's surprising because when I started, I thought I'd be sending things to London and maybe Birmingham but, in fact, a high percentage of it is sent abroad, because it's immediate and speedy. W: And how much would it cost, for example, if I wanted to send a fax to the United States? M: Well, a fax to the United States would cost you five pounds for a page. And when you think that in England by the Royal Mail, it would cost you twelve pounds to send a page by special delivery, it's actually a good value. W: Ok. What about your hours? How long do you have to spend actually in the shop? M: Well, the shop is open from eight in the morning until six at night, six days a week, and then a sort of fairly flexible morning on a Sunday. Urn, and of those hours, I'm in it quite a lot. W: And did you enjoy it? M: Yes, overall I enjoy it.

Carla: Well, what seems to be the problem? Steve: Well, I thought I had the flu, but the doctor said it was just a bad cold. He gave me some cold medicine to take care of my stuffy nose and fever. I'm supposed to take the medicine three times a day after eating, but it doesn't seem to help. He also told me to stay off my feet for a day or so, but I'm so busy these days.

Caller: I'm kind of desperate, and I need something right away. Apartment Owner: Okay. What would you like to know? Caller: First of all, how big is it? Apartment Owner: It's a two-bedroom apartment with a living room, dining room and kitchen, and one bathroom. There's also a place for a washer and dryer. Caller: Okay, and how old is the apartment complex? Apartment Owner: Well, let's just say it has a lot of history. To be honest, my great grandfather built it during the 1920s, but it's a very sturdy and sound structure. Caller: Oh, and ... so, is the apartment furnished at all? Apartment Owner: Oh, yeah. The apartment is partially furnished with a refrigerator, stove, and my grandmother's old dishwasher. Caller: Your grandmother's old dishwasher? Okay. What's the rent? Apartment Owner: It's $950 a month. Apartment Owner: Whoa. That is a little steep for me. Caller: But you could always split the cost with a roommate. Caller: Perhaps. Does that include utilities? Caller: Well, the rent includes gas and electricity, but not the phone bill. And the water pump is right out the back door. Caller: Water pump! [Yeah.] Oh, yeah. Well, can I rent month-to-month, or do I have to sign a lease for a longer period of time? Apartment Owner: We require a 6-month commitment for the apartment, and if you cancel the agreement anytime during that period, hey ... you lose your deposit. Caller: Oh, and how much is the deposit? Apartment Owner: It's $400, and, of course, this money is used to repair damage or general wear and tear on our apartment, like the leaks in the old roof from last year's snow storm. Man, that was ugly. Plaster falling down from the ceiling. And I didn't even know there was a rat's nest up there, but we got that taken care of. Caller: A what? Do I get my deposit back after I move out? That's assuming that I even move in. Apartment Owner: Generally speaking, we return the deposit, minus a small fee for, you know, cleaning the apartment for the next tenant, but if you trash the place, then don't expect to get anything back. Caller: Okay. Oh, um ... how close is the apartment to the university campus? Apartment Owner: It's about eight blocks from campus, but you can catch a number of busses right out in front. Caller: Oh, so, then, if there's a busy road out front, is it noisy? Apartment Owner: Well, there are always trade-offs: it's a little noisy with the road outside and the airport behind you, but the place is really convenient because there's a supermarket and shopping center right across the street. Just keep the windows closed and a pair of ear plugs handy, and you'll be fine. Caller: Okay, and one last question. Are there parking spaces for tenants? Apartment Owner: Yeah. The apartment has two covered parking spaces, which are really convenient during certain times of the year. Caller: Uh ... I don't know. Is it possible for me to drop by and visit the apartment tomorrow morning? Apartment Owner: Sure, but just remember we rent the apartment on a first-come, first-serve basis, so there's no guarantee it'll still be available then. Caller: Okay. Thanks. Um ... and where exactly is the apartment located? Apartment Owner: It's one block west of the waste water treatment plant. Caller: Ah .... Are pets allowed? Apartment Owner: Well, you can keep small pets like a hamster in a small cage, but we don't allow larger animals like dogs, cats, or snakes. Things like that. Caller: Um, I have a rat ... Apartment Owner: You don't have anything like that, do you? Caller: Well, I have a rat that I keep in a cage. Will that be okay? Apartment Owner: Well, as long it doesn't escape, I guess that's okay.

W: What do you mean by the behavioral aspects? M: Well, that's I think where the art comes in. In your behavior, you can either be an actor.

She looks like the intellectual type. Ed: Oh come on man! What kind of woman do you like? Rocky: I want a woman who's affectionate and fulfills my every need, and that woman over there is just not the right type. Ed: Hey. Where have you been? Times are changing, and you're never going to find a woman who will shine your shoes and pick up after you all the time. Wake up. Rocky: Oh really? I meet a lot of women like that, but not at this party. [Oh.] I also prefer a woman who'll stay home, cook, clean, and watch the kids. Ed: Okay, but what are your household responsibilities once you get home from work? Rocky: Hmm. Eat, watch TV, and throw out the garbage. Ed: Wait, wait, wait. I can't believe I'm hearing this. In fact, you're never going to get married. I recently read a news report that said 40 percent of women don't think their husbands do their share around the house, and you seem to be that type. Rocky: Well, that's the way I am, but what's YOUR idea of the perfect woman? Ed: Well, I like a woman who's outgoing, caring, and non-judgmental about people's differences, and it bothers me when people think their the center of the universe ... like someone I know. Rocky: Well, that's nice for you, but that doesn't change my point of view. I guess I'll have to go home to a TV dinner and my dog, Rusty. Ed: Hey, and if I stick with you, this is going to be a long, lonely night. Say hello to Rusty for me. Based on the above dialogue, answer the following questions.

But remember the old people themselves are often against the idea of going to live with a young family. You see, modern houses and flats are very small; much smaller than the sort of homes people used to live in. W: And when Granny gets very old, then the situation becomes even worse, doesn't it? M: Yes. As long as old people are able to look after themselves, the system works quite well. But as soon as they need any care and attention, the situation becomes very difficult indeed. It's likely that old people may go into a nursing home, but it's not as simple as that. Because of improvements in medical science, people live longer than ever before. The birth rate has fallen. This means that a smaller working population is having to provide for a larger number of old people in need of care and attention. The number of old people's homes provided by the State is strictly limited. There are private nursing homes, but the cost is out of reach of the average family. W: And how do you see the situation developing in the future? M: Well, obviously a lot of money is going to have to be spent. But it's difficult persuading people to do this. There aren't many votes for politicians in providing nursing homes for the elderly. Based on the above dialogue, answer the following questions. What problem does the man refer to?\nA. Too low a birth rate.\nB. Care and attention to the old.\nC. More elderly with smaller working population..",

My university and Oxford have an exchange program. Every year Jiaotong University sends several teachers to Oxford; Oxford sends a few professors to Jiaotong. They go to Jiaotong mostly for a few lectures, staying only a few weeks. The Oxford University supplies Chinese teachers with 810 pounds each month.

Let me check to see if we have one available. Hmmm. It's doesn't look like we do. We have a couple of economy, compact, and full-size cars available, or a nice minivan. Customer: Well, what is the main difference between these cars? Agent: The main difference is size. The economy car is the smallest, and it seats fewer passengers and can hold less luggage. [Okay.] How many people are with you? Customer: Just me and my son. Rental Car Agent: Well, the economy car would work. We have one right out front. Customer: Where? That one? It looks more like a shoebox to me. I'm really tall and trying squeeze into that thing ... I don't think so. Rental Car Agent: Well, if you need more room or comfort, I recommend the full-size car. It also has a nice stereo system, CD player, [Alright] safety rear door locks, and cruise control, and power locks and windows. Customer: Well, I'm not so concerned about how it's equipped. I just want to make sure it is comfortable to drive. And what is the daily rate for that anyway? Rental Car Agent: Well, let's see here. Oh, yeah. It'll come to fifty-seven ninety-five a day. Customer: Wow, a little expensive. But what's the cost for mileage? Rental Car Agent: Hey, all of our cars have unlimited miles, but of course, that doesn't include gas. Customer: Yeah, right. I bet that car probably eats up gas, and now that were in the middle of the vacation season, gas stations are gouging consumers with astronomical prices. Rental Car Agent: Well, as they say, it comes down to the law of supply an demand. Customer: Well, anyway, can you install a car seat in one of those cars? I have a 3-year-old son with me. Rental Car Agent: Sure, and that'll only be one dollar extra per day. Customer: I'll go with the full-size car. Wait, uh ... what does it look like? Rental Car Agent: Uh, it's right out there in the parking lot. [Which one?] The one over there next to the sidewalk. Customer: Do you mean that old lemon with the missing hubcap? Ahhh. Rental Car Agent: Sir, excuse me. We take pride in our vehicles. It's just that it's one of the last cars on our lot, but it runs like a dream. Don't let the exterior fool you. Hey, I'll even give you an extra fifteen dollars off the daily rate to show you we are serious about pleasing our customers. Will there be any other drivers? Customer: No, I'm the only driver. Rental Car Agent: Okay. Would you like to purchase our daily car protection plan? Customer: What's that exactly? Rental Car Agent: Well, the car protection plan is a complete insurance package covering damage to the vehicle, [Okay] injury or loss of life to you or your passengers [Oh]. It even includes incidental road damage caused by, let's say, a huge boulder rolling down the mountain and crushing your car. [Oh, uh, well ... ]. However, it won't cover loss of property due to theft. Too much crime in the area anyway. [What? Wh ... What about this crime? What, what?]. Don't worry about it. And the car protection plan is only seventeen ninety-five per day. [But you were saying?] And the nicest thing about this coverage is that you can rent the car without the worry and hassle of making a complicated claim in case you do have a problem. Customer: But wouldn't my own car insurance cover those problems? Rental Car Agent: It might, but each insurance policy is different. With our car protection plan, however, you deal directly with us in case there is a problem [Well ... ], and we handle everything quickly, and you don't have to contact your own insurance company. Okay. Let me just confirm this. A full-size car with a car seat for three days [Yeah], plus the car protection package. Is that right? [That's right.] Okay, I'll have our mechanic, Louie, check the car over and pull it up to the door. Customer: Push it up to the door? I hope this car really runs.

Okay. Let me just confirm this. A full-size car with a car seat for three days [Yeah], plus the car protection package. Is that right? [That's right.] Okay, I'll have our mechanic, Louie, check the car over and pull it up to the door. Customer: Push it up to the door? I hope this car really runs. Rental Car Agent: Well, in case it does break down on some out-of-the-way, deserted road, just call the toll-free number for assistance. They'll come to assist you within ... two business days.

    "input": "Here's a conversation: Rental Car Agent: Hi. How can I help you? Customer: Yeah. I'd like to rent a mid-size car for three days. Rental Car Agent: Okay. Let me check to see if we have one available. Hmmm. It's doesn't look like we do. We have a couple of economy, compact, and full-size cars available, or a nice minivan. Customer: Well, what is the main difference between these cars? Agent: The main difference is size. The economy car is the smallest, and it seats fewer passengers and can hold less luggage. [Okay.] How many people are with you? Customer: Just me and my son. Rental Car Agent: Well, the economy car would work. We have one right out front. Customer: Where? That one? It looks more like a shoebox to me. I'm really tall and trying squeeze into that thing ... I don't think so. Rental Car Agent: Well, if you need more room or comfort, I recommend the full-size car. It also has a nice stereo system, CD player, [Alright] safety rear door locks, and cruise control, and power locks and windows. Customer: Well, I'm not so concerned about how it's equipped. I just want to make sure it is comfortable to drive. And what is the daily rate for that anyway? Rental Car Agent: Well, let's see here. Oh, yeah. It'll come to fifty-seven ninety-five a day. Customer: Wow, a little expensive. But what's the cost for mileage? Rental Car Agent: Hey, all of our cars have unlimited miles, but of course, that doesn't include gas. Customer: Yeah, right. I bet that car probably eats up gas, and now that were in the middle of the vacation season, gas stations are gouging consumers with astronomical prices. Rental Car Agent: Well, as they say, it comes down to the law of supply an demand. Customer: Well, anyway, can you install a car seat in one of those cars? I have a 3-year-old son with me. Rental Car Agent: Sure, and that'll only be one dollar extra per day. Customer: I'll go with the full-size car. Wait, uh ... what does it look like? Rental Car Agent: Uh, it's right out there in the parking lot. [Which one?] The one over there next to the sidewalk. Customer: Do you mean that old lemon with the missing hubcap? Ahhh. Rental Car Agent: Sir, excuse me. We take pride in our vehicles. It's just that it's one of the last cars on our lot, but it runs like a dream. Don't let the exterior fool you.
