- **Deep Learning Architectures**
  - Covered deep learning architectures including **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **Deep Belief Networks (DBNs)**.
    - CNNs focus on architecture, data augmentation techniques, dropout method, and performance on test data.
    - DBNs cover issues with backpropagation, structure and training including Boltzmann Machines, Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), and Deep Boltzmann Machines (DBMs).
    
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**
  - **Kernel or Filter**: Used to extract features from input data. It's a matrix applied to input images or data, aiding in pattern recognition without manual feature extraction.
  
- **Pooling Layer**
  - Reduces dimensionality by selecting representative samples from input features, which lowers the number of parameters, computational complexity, and memory consumption.
  - Improves robustness by minimizing the impact of noise or outliers, enhancing the network's stability and generalization ability.
  
- **Comparison Between CNNs and Traditional Neural Networks**
  - CNNs: Designed for image and video analysis with a special focus on capturing local features through convolutional layers. Used in computer vision tasks.
  - Traditional Neural Networks: General-purpose models used for various data types including text and speech. Usually have fewer layers and lack specialized layers for capturing local features.
  
- **Dropout Technique**
  - **Function**: Prevents overfitting by randomly inactivating neurons during training, promoting robust learning and generalization by reducing dependency on specific neurons or groups.
  - **Application**: Useful in large networks or deep learning models for enhancing model performance and mitigating overfitting risks.
